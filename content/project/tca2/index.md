[Advancing Computational Grounded Theory for Audiovisual Data from STEM Classrooms](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920796&HistoricalAwards=false) is a three-year collaborative project among faculty at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU); and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The project is led by Christina Krist, UIUC assistant professor of curriculum and instruction. This project is focused on developing a new research methodology that uniquely combines two approaches: interpretative human-driven coding and newer machine learning techniques, also known as artificial intelligence. The aim is to use audio-visual data from STEM classrooms to study the kinds of teaching and learning of most interest to educational researchers rather than simply what can be studied using machine learning.The $1.3 million dollar grant will support a postdoctoral scholar at MTSU and graduate research assistants at UIUC.
