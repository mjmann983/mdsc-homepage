abstract: 'Analyzing and interpreting data is essential to the practice of scientists and is also an essential
  science and engineering practice for science teaching and learning. Although working with data
  has benefits in terms of student learning, it is also challenging, particularly with respect to
  aspects of work with data that are not yet very common, such as developing quantitative models,
  understanding variation in data, and using larger, complex data sources. In this article, we aim to
  describe tools for engaging students in work with data in your class as well as three general
  strategies, from understanding how the data were collected to how to include the messier parts of
  preparing a data set for analysis and then modeling the data in order to answer a driving question.
  We show how these strategies can be employed using the freely-available, browser-based tools.'
