Alex Lishinski (PhD, Michigan State University) is a postdoctoral education researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His research is mostly in the field of computer science education, focusing on motivation-related constructs. Dr. Lishinski is especially interested in the unique motivational and emotional difficulties faced by students learning programming and computational thinking skills for the first time. Dr. Lishinski is also interested in developing measures and measurement approaches to investigate the more fine-grained aspects of students' motivational and emotional experiences during the learning process. Dr. Lishinski's work primarily makes use of quantitative methods such as structural equation modeling, item response theory, and hierarchical linear models.
